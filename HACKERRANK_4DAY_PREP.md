## 📝 Interview Script (Say This Out Loud!)

```
1. "Let me first understand the problem..."
2. "I'll start with the brute force approach..."
3. "Now let me optimize - I can use [pattern]..."
4. "The time complexity is O(n) because..."
5. "Space complexity is O(n) for the hash map..."
6. "Let me handle edge cases: empty input, single element..."
```

| Single loop | O(n) | O(1) |
| Nested loops | O(n²) | O(1) |
| Sorting | O(n log n) | O(n) |
| BFS/DFS | O(V + E) | O(V) |
| Binary Search | O(log n) | O(1) |
| Heap operations | O(log n) | O(n) |

## 🔥 HackerRank Tips

1. **Read ALL test cases** before coding
2. **Handle edge cases** - empty, single element, duplicates
3. **Use descriptive variable names** (helps you think)
4. **Comment your approach** (interviewers read your code!)
5. **Run sample tests** before submitting
6. **Watch time limit** - O(n²) usually fails for n > 10⁴

Good luck! 🍀
